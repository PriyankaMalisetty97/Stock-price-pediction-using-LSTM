# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing stock market data
- Normalizing and reshaping data for LSTM input
- Building and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualizing predicted vs. actual stock prices

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
