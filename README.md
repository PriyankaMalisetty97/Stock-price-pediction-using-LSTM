# üìà Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict stock prices based on historical data. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## üß† Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates:
- Loading and preprocessing stock market data
- Normalizing and reshaping data for LSTM input
- Building and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualizing predicted vs. actual stock prices

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PriyankaMalisetty97/Stock-price-pediction-using-LSTM.git
   cd Stock-price-pediction-using-LSTM
2.Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook Stock_price_prediction.ipynb
3.Install required libraries (if not already installed):
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Run all cells to train the model and visualize predictions.
